#### 

## Roadmap

- [x] Logging
- [x] Language handling
- [x] Command handling
- [x] Migrating to async filesystem operations and async API methods for command handling
- [x] Improving language handler with new helper methods, such as getting available localizations, validating localization object, appending new entries to the localization file without overwriting it
- [ ] Advanced command parsing with single quotation marks and arrays (not sure if needed)
- [ ] ~~Auto permission handling~~ (refused)
